# Fast-Fourier Transform with intermittent power-source
Effort in making a solution for FFT analysis with an intermittent power source. Implementation is done on a MSP430 microcontroller development kit and will later be tested on real prototypes at Delft University of Technology.

## Team members
The team consists of three students from the master Embedded Systems at TU Delft:
 - [Carlo Delle Donne](https://github.com/cdelledonne)
 - [Dimitris Patoukas](https://github.com/dpatoukas)
 - [Thijmen Ketel](https://github.com/thijmenketel)

## Hardware
The project is implemented on a MSP430FR5994 from Texas Instruments (information can be found [here](http://www.ti.com/tool/msp-exp430fr5994)).

## Documentation
