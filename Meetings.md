# Sunday March 5th 2017
DEADLINE Thursday march 9
   - Metrics (initial)
   - First implementation of DFT on MSP
   - Plan of Approach (sort of)

### TO DO:
 - Implement the DFT in the MSP
	- Record on ShareLateX
	- Make sure it works (check with pc implementation)

### Working points:
 - Organising (creating repo, making latex file, installing IDE, working with some code)
 - Getting to know the MSP430
 - Trying to convert DFT code to work on MSP430
    - Did not work out of the box
    - MSP430 cannot do FLT calculations on a hardware level
    - Trying to import QMATH library
    - Trying to understand QMATH FLT representation
    - Deciding on the accuracy of the DFT
    - Converting the DFT program to QMATH compatible code
        - Creating the input array
        - Checking the input array through comparing it with an original C-program
    -
 - Typing experiences in LaTeX


# Tuesday March 7th 2017
This wasnt a real meeting due to time constraints. Carlo and Thijmen met to discuss some of the code Carlo wrote and the progress that was made.

### TO DO:
 - Continue report writing
 - Getting synced with other members of the team

### Working points:
 - Finishing up first version of the report before Thursday
 - Meeting on Wednesday to discuss course of action
 - Brainstorm on ideas to implement a version of DINO
 - Try to optimize the DFT implemented by Carlo

# Wednesday March 8th 2017
Meeting after lunch.

### TO DO
 - Discuss progress and timeline
 - Small Brainstorm

### Working points
 -
